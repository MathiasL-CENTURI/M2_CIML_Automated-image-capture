Institute: CIML  
Engineer: Mathias Lechelon  
Submission date: 15/07/2020  
Summary : <em>Optimize the automation of the image capture already present ( DMS300 / Workstation Tecan gemini).
The aim of the optimization will be to replace the currently used automaton with an X-Y automated platform system.
Create a plexiglass enclosure to control the environment (humidity, temperature) around the camera and the X-Y platform.
Optimize the imaging instrument, to obtain higher quality images.</em>
